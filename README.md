# cardcatRlogue

An R package with book and package .bib files

This package grew out of a frustration with creating and maintaining stand-alone reference files ("book.bib" and "package.bib") for three bookdown books, where there is significant overlap in the content of the references used.

In response, {cardcatRlogue} contains "book.bib" and "package.bib" files that will be used to populate the reference sections of all the books. The files can be copied to the appropriate bookdown-based book projects using the functions within the package.
